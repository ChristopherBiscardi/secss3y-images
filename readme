Image Conversion To CSS3 using node.js
______________

Currently a 25 pixel width is hard coded in.


RoadMap:

Auto-detect width of image.
Stream image information in for larger images (currently only supports a limited size)
Generate less CSS classes(currently generates 1class/pixel)
Generate less markup (consecutive similar pixels should be 1 div)
Support More Browsers( Currently only webkit)
